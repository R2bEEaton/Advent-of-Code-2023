# Day 3
Spent a while on Part 1 down the wrong rabbit hole, but cleared it up in the end.

## Part 1
This works by looping through line by line, character by character building numbers as it goes. Once it reaches the end of a number, the program then goes back and checks all digits in the number for adjacent special characters. Once it finds one, it adds it to the answer. Spent a decent amount of time before I realized it wasn't catching numbers at the end of lines, so I solved this by just adding another period at the end.
```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)
ans = 0

for i in range(len(din)):
    num = ""
    din[i] += "."
    for j in range(len(din[i])):
        char = din[i][j]
        if char.isdigit():
            num += char
        else:
            if len(num):
                breakout = False
                for offset in range(1, len(num) + 1):
                    for k in range(-1, 2):
                        for l in range(-1, 2):
                            if breakout:
                                break
                            try:
                                c = din[i+k][j-offset+l]
                                if not c.isdigit() and c != ".":
                                    ans += int(num)
                                    breakout = True
                            except:
                                None
            num = ""

aocd_submit(ans)
```

## Part 2
This one was a surprisingly quick modification to instead check for all adjacent and *unique* "gear" characters. I did this by storing them in a `defaultdict` which always comes in handy. I append each number to the corresponding gear, then pick out the ones with only two numbers at the end and sum their products.

You may need to turn your head diagonally to appreciate it in all of its glory.
```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
from collections import defaultdict

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)
ans = 0

gears = defaultdict(list)

for i in range(len(din)):
    num = ""
    din[i] += "."
    for j in range(len(din[i])):
        char = din[i][j]
        if char.isdigit():
            num += char
        else:
            if len(num):
                geared_already = []
                breakout = False
                for offset in range(1, len(num) + 1):
                    for k in range(-1, 2):
                        for l in range(-1, 2):
                            if breakout:
                                break
                            try:
                                c = din[i+k][j-offset+l]
                                if c == "*" and [i+k, j-offset+l] not in geared_already:
                                    gears["%s %s" % (i+k, j-offset+l)].append(int(num))
                                    geared_already.append([i+k, j-offset+l])
                            except:
                                None
            num = ""

for items in gears.values():
    if len(items) == 2:
        ans += items[0] * items[1]

aocd_submit(ans)
```
