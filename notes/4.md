# Day 4
I got sloppy and didn't read the description fully.

|      | Part 1 | Part 2 | Total |
|------|--------|--------|-------|
| Time | 8:17   | 11:20  | 19:37 |

## Part 1
Time slowers involved the following
- Not realizing the example data wasn't as wide as the real data
- Accidentally including the card number
- Accidentally submitting the wrong answer because of these several times
```python
from helpers.datagetter import data_in, submit

din = data_in(split=True, numbers=True)
ans = 0

for card in din:
    winners = card[1:11]
    mine = card[11:]

    w = 0
    for num in winners:
        if num in mine:
            w += 1

    if w > 0:
        ans += 2 ** (w - 1)

submit(ans)
```

## Part 2
Nothing too special, just took a little to think of the solution. Then of course to remember to switch the 6 back to 11 again, which cost me a minute due to timeout.
```python
from helpers.datagetter import data_in, submit

din = data_in(split=True, numbers=True)
copies = [1 for _ in range(len(din))]

for i in range(len(din)):
    card = din[i]
    winners = card[1:11]
    mine = card[11:]

    w = 0
    for num in winners:
        if num in mine:
            w += 1
    if w > 0:
        for j in range(i+1, i+w+1):
            copies[j] += copies[i]

ans = sum(copies)
submit(ans)
```
