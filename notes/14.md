# Day 14
Fun one! Refreshingly fast. I got 518 and 240 worldwide ranking. That's my second best Part 2 time this year.

## Part 1
I just bruteforced it. Made some code for (inefficiently) making the round rocks fall upward.
```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)
ans = 0

moved = True
while moved:
    moved = False
    for i in range(1, len(din)):
        for j in range(len(din[0])):
            if din[i][j] == "O" and din[i-1][j] == ".":
                din[i] = [c for c in din[i]]
                din[i][j] = "."
                din[i-1] = [c for c in din[i-1]]
                din[i-1][j] = "O"
                din[i] = "".join(din[i])
                din[i-1] = "".join(din[i-1])
                moved = True


for i in range(len(din)):
    ans += din[i].count("O") * (len(din) - i)

aocd_submit(ans)
```

## Part 2
For this, I knew it would be a familiar cycles problem which we have seen many times in years past. After recently learning about `functools` caching from [Day 12](notes/12.md) (shudder) I figured this would be a fun usecase. It took significantly longer (40 seconds to identify the loop, 4 minutes to run through the 1000000000 cycles) than the "correct" approach, but it saved me the headache of having to come up with the looping logic. I know it saved time because I did it! See Part 3.
```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
import functools
import tqdm

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=False, numbers=False)
ans = 0


@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def cycle(din):
    din = din.split("\n")
    # North
    moved = True
    while moved:
        moved = False
        for i in range(1, len(din)):
            for j in range(len(din[0])):
                if din[i][j] == "O" and din[i-1][j] == ".":
                    din[i] = [c for c in din[i]]
                    din[i][j] = "."
                    din[i-1] = [c for c in din[i-1]]
                    din[i-1][j] = "O"
                    din[i] = "".join(din[i])
                    din[i-1] = "".join(din[i-1])
                    moved = True

    # West
    moved = True
    while moved:
        moved = False
        for i in range(len(din)):
            for j in range(1, len(din[0])):
                if din[i][j] == "O" and din[i][j-1] == ".":
                    din[i] = [c for c in din[i]]
                    din[i][j] = "."
                    din[i][j-1] = "O"
                    din[i] = "".join(din[i])
                    moved = True

    # South
    moved = True
    while moved:
        moved = False
        for i in range(len(din) - 1):
            for j in range(len(din[0])):
                if din[i][j] == "O" and din[i+1][j] == ".":
                    din[i] = [c for c in din[i]]
                    din[i][j] = "."
                    din[i+1] = [c for c in din[i+1]]
                    din[i+1][j] = "O"
                    din[i] = "".join(din[i])
                    din[i+1] = "".join(din[i+1])
                    moved = True

    # East
    moved = True
    while moved:
        moved = False
        for i in range(len(din)):
            for j in range(0, len(din[0]) - 1):
                if din[i][j] == "O" and din[i][j+1] == ".":
                    din[i] = [c for c in din[i]]
                    din[i][j] = "."
                    din[i][j+1] = "O"
                    din[i] = "".join(din[i])
                    moved = True

    return "\n".join(din)


for _ in tqdm.tqdm(range(1000000000)):
    din = cycle(din)

din = din.split("\n")
for i in range(len(din)):
    ans += din[i].count("O") * (len(din) - i)

aocd_submit(ans)
```

## Part 3
This code massively optimizes the incredibly slow string-to-list-to-string nonsense from my round rock roller. Then, it finds the cycle in the code and calculates where it would be after running through the process 1000000000 times, calculates the total load of that (already-saved) status, and that's the answer!

This takes about 9 seconds to run for my input. Unfortunately, the biggest time-waster is the serialization of the 2d arrays so that they can be saved. If I just appended `din` to `found`, `din` is actually just a memory reference to the same position in memory. I need to actually copy the data first, and `.copy()` only does a shallow copy, so the fastest thing I could find was to use `json.dumps()`. I tried `copy.deepcopy()`, converting into strings, etc. and this seemed to be the fastest.

from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)
now = time.time()
for i in range(len(din)):
    din[i] = [c for c in din[i]]

                    grid[i][j] = "."
                    grid[i - 1][j] = "O"
                    moved = True
