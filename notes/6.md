# Day 6
I felt this was pretty quick. Most of the slowness came from thinking it would be harder than this.

|      | Part 1 | Part 2 | Total |
|------|--------|--------|-------|
| Time | 5:05   | 3:41   | 8:46  |

## Part 1
A simple algorithm for computing the final score, then check every one. I know there's a better way since the algorithm is pretty simple. Maybe I'll do a Part Three for fun.
```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=True)
ans = 1


def compute_score(hold_time, total_time):
    return (total_time-hold_time) * hold_time


for i in range(len(din[0])):
    print(din[0][i], din[1][i])
    wins = []
    for j in range(din[0][i]):
        if compute_score(j, din[0][i]) > din[1][i]:
            wins.append(j)
    ans *= len(wins)

aocd_submit(ans)
```

## Part 2
Was worried for a minute that the input would be too big to search bruteforce, but it only took about 13 seconds. Took too long to realize that and just make the simple changes.
```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)
din[0] = int(din[0].split(":")[1].replace(" ", ""))
din[1] = int(din[1].split(":")[1].replace(" ", ""))
ans = 1


def compute_score(hold_time, total_time):
    return (total_time-hold_time) * hold_time


wins = []
for j in range(din[0]):
    if compute_score(j, din[0]) > din[1]:
        wins.append(j)
ans *= len(wins)

aocd_submit(ans)
```

## Part 3 (for fun, doing it the smarter way)
Compute the first positive intercept of the function and the best score. The polynomial is symmetric between 0 and Time, so that's all you need to find the other intercept. Compute the difference between them, and add one to include both endpoints.
```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
import math

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)
din = [int(i.split(":")[1].replace(" ", "")) for i in din]

intercept = math.ceil((-din[0] + math.sqrt(din[0] ** 2 - (4 * din[1]))) / -2)
ans = din[0] - 2 * intercept + 1

aocd_submit(ans)
```
