# Day 24
Some limited linear algebra knowledge came in handy - except I had no idea how to actually do it.

## Part 1
Part 1 was fun! My solution was as follows:

1) For each unique pair of hailstones, get the first point and the immediate next point in the future
2) Then I computed the point of intersection given two points on each of two lines which I found on the Wikipedia page for [Line-line intersection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line%E2%80%93line_intersection#Given_two_points_on_each_line)
   1) I now see that it would have been quicker to implement given two line equations, but alas, I still got a great worldwide placement of 175
3) If they have an intersection point, check if that point is in range
4) If it is in range, check if that point is in the future for both points
   1) I did this by checking if each line's second point was closer to the intersection than the respective first point
5) If all conditions are satisfied, we can count it as a pair of lines that intersect in the future within the defined range

Then the answer is the number of such intersections.
```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
import itertools

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=True)
ans = 0

for pair in itertools.combinations(din, 2):
    L1, L2 = pair
    x1, y1 = L1[0], L1[1]
    x2, y2 = L1[0] + L1[3], L1[1] + L1[4]
    x3, y3 = L2[0], L2[1]
    x4, y4 = L2[0] + L2[3], L2[1] + L2[4]

    try:
        # Compute intersection given two points on two lines
        Px = ((x1 * y2 - y1 * x2) * (x3 - x4) - (x1 - x2) * (x3 * y4 - y3 * x4)) / ((x1 - x2) * (y3 - y4) - (y1 - y2) * (x3 - x4))
        Py = ((x1 * y2 - y1 * x2) * (y3 - y4) - (y1 - y2) * (x3 * y4 - y3 * x4)) / ((x1 - x2) * (y3 - y4) - (y1 - y2) * (x3 - x4))

        # In range
        if 200000000000000 <= Px <= 400000000000000 and 200000000000000 <= Py <= 400000000000000:
            # In future
            if abs(Px - x2) < abs(Px - x1) and abs(Py - y2) < abs(Py - y1) and abs(Px - x4) < abs(Px - x3) and abs(Py - y4) < abs(Py - y3):
                ans += 1
    except:
        None

aocd_submit(ans)
```

## Part 2
I was racking my brain about solutions to this. First I thought of going through each pair of hailstones and then computing the lines between each pair of futures up to some threshhold `n`, and checking if any of those `n^2` lines also intersected with all the other lines at some point in their futures. I sort of was assuming that there would be very few lines that would intersect all these lines in 3D space, so if I found one answer that would probably be it.

But then I looked at the input... definitely not feasible.

I took a linear algebra class a couple semesters ago, so I was able to relatively quickly make the jump to the fact that this is probably the answer to a system of equations solving for some line that intersects with all other lines at integer times. The input was also given in such a way that screams **vector** (`x y z @ dx dy dz`) so I knew that was probably it. 

But what was that system of equations? I think given another hour or so, I would have figured it out, but that doesn't mean much since I didn't end up doing that.

I was about to give up and go to bed, but I realized I wouldn't have a lot of time tomorrow to do much of this, so I decided to look at some Reddit solutions.

Turns out there's this pretty epic Python module called [z3-solver](https://github.com/z3prover/z3) which basically does... everything? It can pretty much prove anything and it seems to be really great for systems of equations like this, and ends up solving for all variables: an initial position, an initial velocity, and the times each hailstone will be hit. And all that in under a second too, insane.

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
from z3 import *

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=True)

rock = [Real('r%s' % i) for i in range(3)]
rock_v = [Real('rv%s' % i) for i in range(3)]
s = Solver()

for i in range(len(din)):
    point = din[i]
    t = Real('t%s' % i)
    for c in range(3):
        s.add(rock[c] + t*rock_v[c] == point[c] + t*point[3 + c])

if s.check() == sat:
    m = s.model()
    aocd_submit(sum([int(str(m.evaluate(v))) for v in rock]))
