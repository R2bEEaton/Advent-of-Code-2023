## Part 1
A fun one! I use a dictionary to hold the workflows, and evaluated them recursively until an A was reached.

I will be honest, the code using `eval` was not how the code was at the time of my submission. However, I did try using `eval` because I figured it would allow for a REALLY concise definition of the rules processor, not having to parse the variable name, condition, and number. But for some reason, when I tried it earlier, it didn't work. When discussing with a friend, I mentioned I had tried to use it, but that it didn't work.

Then I tried it again and it worked, so gosh darn, I will post it and pretend I did it that way because I definitely did.
```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)
ans = 0

workflows = {}

for i in range(len(din)):
    line = din[i]
    if line == "":
        break

    name = line.split("{")[0]
    raw_rules = line.split("{")[1][:-1].split(",")

    rules = []
    for r in raw_rules:
        if ":" in r:
            rules.append((r.split(":")[0], r.split(":")[1]))
        else:
            rules.append((1, r))

    workflows[name] = rules


def do_workflow(w, xmas):
    if w == "R":
        return False
    elif w == "A":
        return True

    x, m, a, s = xmas

    for rule in workflows[w]:
    if eval(str(rule[0])):
        return do_workflow(rule[1], xmas)


for j in range(i + 1, len(din)):
    line = din[j]
    xmas = [int(x.split("=")[1]) for x in line[1:-1].split(",")]
    if do_workflow("in", xmas):
        ans += sum(xmas)

aocd_submit(ans)
```

## Part 2
Ok, can't use eval anymore.

I knew I needed to use range math again from the get-go, so the first thing I did was refactor my code to work on ranges of ratings instead of individual part ratings. The workflow paths are recursively explored, shaving off valid ranges when necessary, until an accept stage is reached. Then, I figured, the answer would be the sum of the combinations it takes to get to each individual accept stage.
This is because each individual set of ratings can get to only one accept stage. Therefore, no overlap. 

My one hiccup that took a while to catch was that as I move on to the next rule in one workflow, I have already lost the range of X, M, A, or S that went down the previous rule. I was going through each rule from each workflow as if they were the same, not accounting for the loss. A simple change to update the lost XMAS rating with the opposite range, and the answer popped right up.

Unfortunate that I missed it, because I definitely had most of it earlier than that.
```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)
ans = 0

workflows = {}

for line in din:
    if line == "":
        break

    name = line.split("{")[0]
    raw_rules = line.split("{")[1][:-1].split(",")

    rules = []
    for r in raw_rules:
        if ":" in r:
            rules.append((r.split(":")[0], r.split(":")[1]))
        else:
            rules.append((1, r))

    workflows[name] = rules


def do_workflow(w, xmas):
    x, m, a, s = xmas

    if w == "R":
        return 0
    elif w == "A":
        return (x[1] - x[0] + 1) * (m[1] - m[0] + 1) * (a[1] - a[0] + 1) * (s[1] - s[0] + 1)

    track = 0
    for rule in workflows[w]:
        if str(rule[0])[0] == "1":
            track += do_workflow(rule[1], xmas)
            continue
        to_modify = "xmas".index(str(rule[0])[0])

        num = int(rule[0][2:])
        xmas_copy = xmas.copy()
        if rule[0][1] == "<":
            if xmas[to_modify][0] >= num:
                continue
            if xmas[to_modify][1] < num:
                track += do_workflow(rule[1], xmas)
                continue
            xmas_copy[to_modify] = (xmas[to_modify][0], num - 1)
            xmas[to_modify] = (num, xmas[to_modify][1])
            track += do_workflow(rule[1], xmas_copy)
        else:
            if xmas[to_modify][1] <= num:
                continue
            if xmas[to_modify][0] > num:
                track += do_workflow(rule[1], xmas)
                continue
            xmas_copy[to_modify] = (num + 1, xmas[to_modify][1])
            xmas[to_modify] = (xmas[to_modify][0], num)
            track += do_workflow(rule[1], xmas_copy)
    return track


aocd_submit(do_workflow("in", [(1, 4000), (1, 4000), (1, 4000), (1, 4000)]))
