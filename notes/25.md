# Day 25
A cool problem, learned about a neat module.

## Part 1
I started by trying the bruteforce approach (you can check Part 3 if you want to see it, but you really don't) before spending 45 minutes on it, fixing bugs, etc... and finding out that it would take years to finish.

I was picking all possible combinations of 3 wires to remove, and checking the sizes of the connected sections after their removal. Happy to say it works on the sample!

Then I tried to come up with a way to figure out which three edges were crossed the most when running BFS fully from one node to another node, for each pair of nodes. I figured that the bridges would be travelled on most commonly. In the example, one of the correct wires did show up on top, but the other two were buried a little further down in the ranking. This futile solution has been lost to the sands of time, what a shame.

After realizing that I couldn't come up with a valid algorithm, I figured I'd look into it online. I found the concept of a [Bridge in graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_(graph_theory)) but all algorithms for finding them seemed to only work on graphs with single bridges - not sure if this is accurate, but that's what I got from my understanding. However, a potential bruteforce that utilizes that fact is instead of `C(n, 3)` combinations, it would be a much more manageable `C(n, 2)`, then just check if the resulting graph has a bridge. Though I still think my terrible bruteforce code would have taken too long to be reasonable.

So... I decided way too late to check if there was perhaps a Python module or something that figured this out. I looked at one hint, suggesting that [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) would be great for this problem, and lo and behold, there it was in their [Connectivity](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/connectivity.html) section, an aptly named [minimum_edge_cut](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.connectivity.cuts.minimum_edge_cut.html#networkx.algorithms.connectivity.cuts.minimum_edge_cut) function which literally returns the minimum set of edges to remove from a graph G that would disconnect G - exactly what I was looking for.

I spent a couple of minutes learning the syntax for NX and somehow it is able to compute this problem in a couple of seconds. I first needed to find the edges to remove, then actually remove them, and finally get the size of the remaining partitions of the graph.

[Some info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_cut) about the minimum cut problem. [Some more in-depth info.](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/minimum-cut-graphs)

```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
import networkx as nx

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)
ans = 1

G = nx.Graph()

for line in din:
    curr, others = line.split(": ")
    others = others.split(" ")
    for other in others:
        G.add_edge(curr, other)

for edge in nx.minimum_edge_cut(G):
    G.remove_edge(edge[0], edge[1])

for x in nx.connected_components(G):
    ans *= len(x)

aocd_submit(ans)
```

## Part 2
I just pushed the big red button, I don't know what else to tell you!

## Part 3
Ewww bad ugly slow... but working code that I was working on for Part 1. It bruteforce checks the consequences of removing all combinations of 3 wires. I also learned that `.discard()` exists for sets, and I totally didn't have `try ... catch` blocks wrapping all 6 `.remove()`s beforehand!
```python
# This is the very slow, bad version lol

import itertools
from copy import deepcopy
import tqdm
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
from collections import defaultdict, deque

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)
ans = 0

conns = defaultdict(set)
connections = []

for line in din:
    curr, others = line.split(": ")
    others = others.split(" ")
    for other in others:
        conns[curr].add(other)
        conns[other].add(curr)
        connections.append([curr, other])


def connects(a, b, c):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([a])
    while queue:
        curr = queue.popleft()

        if curr == b:
            return True

        if curr in visited:
            continue
        visited.add(curr)

        for next in c[curr]:
            queue.append(next)
    return False


wires = list(conns.copy().keys())
for remove_wires in tqdm.tqdm(itertools.combinations(connections, r=3)):
    a, b, c = remove_wires

    conns_copy = deepcopy(conns)

    conns_copy[a[0]].discard(a[1])
    conns_copy[a[1]].discard(a[0])
    conns_copy[b[0]].discard(b[1])
    conns_copy[b[1]].discard(b[0])
    conns_copy[c[0]].discard(c[1])
    conns_copy[c[1]].discard(c[0])

    groups = [[wires[0]], []]
    bad = False
    for wire in wires[1:]:
        if connects(wires[0], wire, conns_copy):
            groups[0].append(wire)
        elif len(groups[1]) == 0 or connects(groups[1][0], wire, conns_copy):
            groups[1].append(wire)
        else:
            bad = True
            break

    if not bad and len(groups[0]) != 0 and len(groups[1]) != 0:
        ans = len(groups[0]) * len(groups[1])
        break
