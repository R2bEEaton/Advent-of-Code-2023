# Day 12
The towel was thrown around 2:00 AM.

## Part 1
Fairly straightforward implementation of a cool problem. I decided to go with the bruteforce approach, similar to [Day 7 with the cards](notes/7.md). I find each `?` and try replacing them with either `.` or `#`, trying every combination. I believe this took about 20 seconds to run for my input.
```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
from itertools import combinations

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)
ans = 0


def match(s, cont):
    out = []
    o = 0
    for char in s:
        if char == "#":
            o += 1
        else:
            if o:
                out.append(o)
                if len(out) > len(cont) or out[-1] != cont[len(out) - 1]:
                    return False
            o = 0
    if o:
        out.append(o)
    return out == cont

for line in din:
    contig = [int(x) for x in line.split(" ")[1].split(",")]
    qs = []
    for i in range(len(line.split(" ")[0])):
        if line[i] == "?":
            qs.append(i)
    combs = [()]
    for r in range(len(qs)):
        combs += combinations(qs, r + 1)

    #print(contig, qs)
    for comb in combs:
        l = list(line.split(" ")[0])
        for i in range(len(l)):
            if i in comb:
                l[i] = "#"
            elif i in qs:
                l[i] = "."
        if match("".join(l), contig):
            #print("".join(l))
            ans += 1

print(ans)
aocd_submit(ans)
```

## Part 2
As expected, the wrinkle in Part 2 made the bruteforce method infeasible by, you know, making the combinations so high that it would take probably several days to do it the same way.

I was really stuck, and to be honest, I threw in the towel at 2:00 AM and looked at Reddit for ideas in the morning. The most common solution I saw was to use a recursive solution with a cache. The tricky part for me was coming up with the way to make it recursive such that it was cacheable.

How did I do it? I didn't. I looked at peoples' great explanations and then I did my best to implement it. I finished around 9:00 AM (totally not during virtual Jury Duty, and I definitely didn't take a long nap today), but I waited to submit until the evening as a courtesy to my fellow private leaderboard members. I felt like the solution wasn't mine and that I wouldn't have gotten it today.

It works by recursively trying each option whenever it hits a `?`. Otherwise, there are many base cases.

I will do my best to explain the code in words. In all cases, the return value is the number of combinations that could be made for the current string, the current size of the group we are counting through, and the group sizes that are remaining to match. Using this as a key for a cache, it is obvious why this would introduce a huge speedup. From other peoples' research, this resulted in roughly a 24% cache hit ratio, and cut down substantially on the number of total function calls that would have been made, due to the frequency of quitting early. 

- If the string is empty
  - If there are more instructions
    - If there is only one group left to make and it matches the group size we were currently counting, that's a match, return 1
    - else return 0
  - else
    - If we weren't counting any group, that's a match, return 1
    - else return 0

- If we are out of groups to make
  - If there are more `#` in the string or we were counting some group, that's not a match, return 0
  - else return 1

- If the first character is `?`
  - return the sum of trying a `#` and a `.` in its place

- If the first character is `#`
  - If this would put the currently counted group over the edge for the group size we are looking for, return 0
  - else If this would match the group we are looking for, move on to the next group, start over the count from 0, and set a flag to expect a `.` (group separator) in this recursive call on the rest of the string
  - else Recursively call the function on the rest of the string, with the current group size incremented

- If the first character is `.`
  - If we were expecting a `.` or if we weren't counting any group, return a recursive call on the rest of the string, with the same current group and count set to 0
  - else If the counted group size matches the group size we were looking for, recursively check the rest of the string on the next group size, resetting the count to 0
  - else return 0 because `.`'s separates all groups and a different group size was expected

Of course after reviewing other peoples' explanations, this makes perfect sense to me, and the cache really works wonders on this. Still, I wish I could have come up with the solution entirely on my own. I sort of knew this would be along the lines of the solution, but that's a heck of a lot of base cases and recursive cases.
```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
import functools

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)
ans = 0


@functools.lru_cache()
def recurse(s, instructions, group_size, done):
    if len(s) == 0:
        if instructions:
            if len(instructions) == 1 and group_size == instructions[0]:
                return 1
            return 0
        else:
            if group_size == 0:
                return 1
            return 0

    if len(instructions) == 0:
        if "#" in s or group_size != 0:
            return 0
        return 1

    curr = s[0]
    rest = s[1:]

    if curr == "?":
        return recurse("#" + rest, instructions, group_size, done) + recurse("." + rest, instructions, group_size, done)

    if curr == "#":
        if group_size + 1 > instructions[0]:
            return 0
        elif group_size == instructions[0]:
            return recurse(rest, instructions[1:], 0, True)
        return recurse(rest, instructions, group_size + 1, False)

    if curr == ".":
        if done or group_size == 0:
            return recurse(rest, instructions, 0, False)
        else:
            if group_size == instructions[0]:
                return recurse(rest, instructions[1:], 0, False)
            return 0


for line in din:
    contig = ((line.split(" ")[0] + "?") * 5)[:-1]
    instrs = tuple([int(x) for x in ((line.split(" ")[1] + ",") * 5)[:-1].split(",")])

    a = recurse(contig, instrs, 0, False)
    ans += a
