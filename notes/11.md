# Day 11
A fun problem! I was scared for Part 2 but it was surprisingly straightforward to implement once I thought of the solution.

## Part 1
For Part One I just found and inserted the duplicate rows, then computed the taxicab distance between each pair of galaxies, summing them as I went along.
```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
from itertools import combinations

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)
ans = 0

expand_rows = []
expand_cols = []

for i in range(len(din)):
    g = 0
    for j in range(len(din[0])):
        if din[i][j] == "#":
            g += 1
    if g == 0:
        expand_rows.append(i)

for j in range(len(din[0])):
    g = 0
    for i in range(len(din)):
        if din[i][j] == "#":
            g += 1
    if g == 0:
        expand_cols.append(j)

for i in range(len(expand_rows)):
    din.insert(expand_rows[i] + i, "".join(["." for _ in range(len(din[0]))]))

for j in range(len(expand_cols)):
    for i in range(len(din)):
        din[i] = din[i][:expand_cols[j] + j] + "." + din[i][expand_cols[j] + j:]

galaxies = []
for i in range(len(din)):
    for j in range(len(din[0])):
        if din[i][j] == "#":
            galaxies.append([i, j])

coms = list(combinations(galaxies, 2))
for pair in coms:
    ans += abs(pair[0][0] - pair[1][0]) + abs(pair[0][1] - pair[1][1])

aocd_submit(ans)
```

## Part 2
This is how I should have theoretically done Part One, the non-bruteforce method.

It scans through the inputs looking for rows and columns that have no galaxies (as before). Then, it scans through again and offsets each galaxy's position by the number of rows or columns that should have been inserted. That way, I can build a list of the true coordinates of each galaxy without actually modifying the list at all.

Finally, compare each pair again and get the sum of all the taxicab distances.
```python
from helpers.datagetter import aocd_data_in
from itertools import combinations

din, aocd_submit = aocd_data_in(split=True, numbers=False)
ans = 0

expand_rows = []
expand_cols = []

for i in range(len(din)):
    g = 0
    for j in range(len(din[0])):
        if din[i][j] == "#":
            g += 1
    if g == 0:
        expand_rows.append(i)

for j in range(len(din[0])):
    g = 0
    for i in range(len(din)):
        if din[i][j] == "#":
            g += 1
    if g == 0:
        expand_cols.append(j)

mult = 1000000
shift_down = 0
galaxies = []
for i in range(len(din)):
    shift_right = 0
    if i in expand_rows:
        shift_down += mult - 1
    else:
        for j in range(len(din[0])):
            if j in expand_cols:
                shift_right += mult - 1
            else:
                if din[i][j] == "#":
                    galaxies.append([i + shift_down, j + shift_right])

coms = list(combinations(galaxies, 2))
for pair in coms:
    ans += abs(pair[0][0] - pair[1][0]) + abs(pair[0][1] - pair[1][1])

aocd_submit(ans)
```
