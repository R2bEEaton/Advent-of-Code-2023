# Ryan Eaton's Advent of Code 2023
A repository to store my solutions for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

Solutions will be slightly refactored for readability before submission. In other words...

```diff
+ Refactor to remove unused code
- No logic changes allowed
- No fixing the stupid or unnecessary checks I wrote
```

I'm going for speed. This repository is not an example of good code. It won't be pretty.
